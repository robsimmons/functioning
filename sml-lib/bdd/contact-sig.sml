(* Contacts between bodies during simulation.

   A "contact" in this sense does not necessarily mean that the two
   bodies are touching, rather, it means that the simulator is tracking
   them because their bounding boxes overlap. Contacts persist to make
   incremental updates more efficient.

   In BoxDiaDia this signature is used twice: Once transparently for
   the internal BDDContact structure, which clients should ignore, and
   once abstractly for the final client interface.
