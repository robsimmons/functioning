  (* A dynamic tree arranges data in a binary tree to accelerate queries
     such as volume queries and ray casts. Leafs are proxies with an
     AABB. In the tree we expand the proxy AABB by b2_fatAABBFactor so
     that the proxy AABB is bigger than the client object. This allows
     the client object to move by small amounts without triggering a
     tree update. *)

     Move a proxy with a swepted AABB. If the proxy has moved outside of
     its fattened AABB, then the proxy is removed from the tree and
     re-inserted. Otherwise the function returns immediately. Returns
     true if the proxy was re-inserted. *)

  (* ray_cast tree callback { p1, p2, max_fraction }

     Ray-cast against the proxies in the tree. This relies on the
     callback to perform an exact ray-cast in the case were the proxy
     contains a shape. The callback also performs the collision
     filtering. This has performance roughly equal to k * log(n),
     where k is the number of collisions and n is the number of
     proxies in the tree.

     The input ray extends from p1 to p1 + maxFraction * (p2 - p1).
     The callback is called for each proxy that is hit by the ray. A
     return value of 0.0 means to stop. *)
