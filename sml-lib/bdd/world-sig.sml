(* A world is a collection of rigid bodies in simulation. Bodies are
   made up of fixtures, each of which is a shape with some physical
   properties like density and a coefficient of friction.

   XXX out of date; describe new strategy if it works
   Port note: I merged several different Box2D classes into this one
   module for BoxDiaDia, because they need to know about each other's
   implementations. They're arranged into sub-structures roughly
   corresponding to the original classes.

   I renamed functions like is_bullet to get_bullet to match with the
   style of the others, since there doesn't seem to be any advantage
   to irregularity.
