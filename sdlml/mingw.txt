[[ NOTE, the version in explat has more up-to-date info on vista
   and other problems you might have. Probably that file should
   replace this one and give unified instructions for compiling
   sdlml programs on windows. ]]


(* install first *)
get MinGW-something.exe from SOURCEFORGE PAGE

get MSYS.exe by searching on google for "msys" and getting the 1.0.10
exe (or newer?) from prdownloads


(* vs tools... *)
dumpbin /imports file.exe
        /dependents

you also need zlib and libpng and libjpeg and libtiff. (If you try to skip jpeg and tiff, configure will work but linking will fail??)
zlib builds with ./configure; make; make install
libpng builds with ./configure CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LIBS=-L/usr/local/lib ; make; make install
  (since zlib puts its stuff in /usr/local for whatever reason..)

libjpeg builds with ./configure ; make; mkdir /usr/local/man/man1 ; make install ; make install-lib
 (* maybe those second to last two aren't necessary, but I did them search for install-lib *)

libtiff builds with ./configure ; make ; make install
                     (you may get illegal instructions in NTVDM??)

[the mingw "ports" do not work for me and anyway are only available for png]



to build SDL_image, first
export SDL_CONFIG=/path/to/explat/SDL/sdl-config
./configure CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LIBS=-L/usr/local/lib ; make; make install

Then in /usr/local/bin/ copy libpng-3.dll to libpng13.dll   (?)

OK, you're set!



Note: according to 
  http://www.spacejack.org/games/mingw/mingw-sdl.html
      it's possible to just use the MSVC binary library (.lib)?



To get directsound support (much lower latency), use the DLL file from
escape. Don't build your own! Then you have to export SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dsound
before running. (Could do this with setenv I guess..)
